Project Done under the supervision of Dr. Won, U of Memphis Computer Scinece Professor
Programs that creates 5 threads. Each thread
generate 1,000 random points and count the number of points that occur within the circle. The
main thread wait for the five threads to terminate one after another. Once a thread is
terminated, the main thread updates the value of PI using the total number of points in the
circle and the total number of points generated by the terminated thread. For example, the
main thread waits for the first thread to terminate. When the first thread is terminated, the
main thread incorporates the total number of points in the circle obtained by the first thread to
update the value of PI. Next, the main thread waits for the second thread to terminate. When
the second thread is terminated, the main thread updates the value of PI using the total
number of points in the circle obtained by the second thread, and so on
